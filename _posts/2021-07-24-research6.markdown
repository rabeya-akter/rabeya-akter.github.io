Developing a Qwen-2.5VL-3B–driven episodic reflection module that generates natural-language self-assessments of each trial to enable human-like introspection, while fusing these reflections with CLIP-style vision–language feedback from task descriptions and goal images to build a dense, semantically grounded reward model. This model is being integrated into a reward-aligned Soft Actor–Critic pipeline to accelerate exploration, reduce training time, and enhance policy convergence across Meta-World manipulation tasks.
